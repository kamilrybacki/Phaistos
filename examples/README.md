# Phaistos usage examples

This directory contains several examples of how to use the Phaistos library. The examples are written in Python and are intended to be run from the command line.

```bash
    python3 <example>.py
```

All examples use YAML manifests located in the `schemas/` directory.

## Examples

* [**`manual.py`**](manual.py): An example of how to manually define a schema and validate data against it to create structured data entries.
